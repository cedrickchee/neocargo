# neoCargo Microservices in Go

neoCargo is a shipping container management platform.

This project is an example of multiple microservices implementation in Go in a [**monorepo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo).

(_Demo ([asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)) coming soon._)

The project main focus is tech proof of concept (POC). So, for that purpose, we try to keep the code simple.

The neoCargo backend consists of 3 microservices:

- [Shipments](./neocargo-service-shipment)
- [Vessels](./neocargo-service-vessel)
- [Users + Authentication](./neocargo-service-user)

## Tech Stack

- [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) as transport protocol
- [go-micro](https://micro.mu/)
- Docker container ([Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/about/) as base image) - smaller image with multi-stage build
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB database
- User authentication with [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [NATS](https://nats.io/)
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

## System Architecture

(_Note: incomplete._)

A good architecture is when services are decoupled. We will achieve that with
event driven architecture or pubsub.

We need to integrate the NATS broker plug-in into our services.

## Prerequisite

- This project assumes you're using Go 1.13 and upwards and have `export GO111MODULE=on` set.
- Install Go
- Install the protoc compiler
- Install gRPC / protobuf
- Install Go libraries:
    - [protoc-gen-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go): The protoc-gen-go binary is a protoc plugin to generate a Go protocol buffer package.

## Usage

### Installation

- Rename file `config.env.example` in project root to `config.env`
- Replace the variables (e.g.: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`) in `config.env`

### Local Development

**Build and run Docker Compose stack**

I created a simple Makefile to build, run, test, and teardown Docker Compose
stack in local development machine.

Just run in project root:

```sh
# Build stack
$ make build

# Run stack
$ make run

docker-compose up

```

You can stop all of your current containers by running:

```sh
# Teardown stack
$ make stop
```

### Testing

Test it all by running our CLI tool.

To run it through docker-compose, run:

- Create a shipment

```sh
$ make run-cli

docker-compose run cli \
        ./neocargo-cli-shipment \
        shipment.json \
        eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ

- Create a user

```sh
$ make run-user-cli

docker-compose run user-cli \

## Deployment

### Terraform a Cluster on Google Cloud

We will create a cloud environment to host our services. We will be using
Terraform to provision and manage our cloud cluster on Google Cloud.

Steps:

- Create your [Google Cloud](http://console.cloud.google.com/) project.
- Go to "IAM & Admin" tab in Google Cloud console and [create a new service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys). Make sure you select "JSON" for "Key type".
- Modify the configurations in our [Infra-as-Code project](./infra).
- Move the service key you created earlier into the project root and name it `gcloud-service-key.json`.

Next, create a new cluster:

```sh
$ terraform init

# View deployment plan
$ terraform plan

# Apply the changes
$ terraform apply
```

Once it's done, see your new cluster. Go to Google Cloud console and look for Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Next, deploy our containers to the cluster.

#### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Set-up and deploy containers into cluster using GKE.

Steps:

- Ensure you have the [kubectl cli installed locally](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart#local-shell):

```
$ gcloud components install kubectl
```

Usually, you'd deploy a PostgreSQL/MongoDB instance, or database instance along
with every service, for complete separation.

Then we deploy our services, shipment-service, vessel-service, and user-service.

**MongoDB containers**

I created three Kubernetes deployment files for MongoDB:
- [storage](./deployment/mongodb-deployment.yml)
- [stateful set](./deployment/mongodb-deployment.yml)
- [our service](./deployment/service.yml)

```sh
$ kubectl create -f ./deployment/mongodb-ssd.yml
$ kubectl create -f ./deployment/mongodb-deployment.yml
$ kubectl create -f ./deployment/mongodb-service.yml
```

The result of this will be a replicated set of MongoDB containers, with stateful storage and a service exposing the datastore across our other pods.

**Vessel service**

I have created a [deployment file for vessel service](./deployment/vessel-service-deployment.yml).

We're pushing and pulling our Docker image from a private [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling).

```sh
$ docker build -t asia.gcr.io/neocargo/vessel-service:latest .
$ gcloud docker -- push asia.gcr.io/neocargo/vessel-service:latest
```

Then, deploy vessel-service to our cluster.

```sh
$ kubectl create -f ./deployments/vessel-service-deployment.yml
$ kubectl create -f ./deployments/vessel-service.yml
```

Do the same for our other services.

**Deploy Micro**

[Deployment](./deployment/micro-deployment.yml) file.

In our service here, we expose an external load balancer, with an IP address out to the public.

Run `$ kubectl get services` to get a public IP address.

After all that's deployed, make a service call to micro container:

```sh
$ curl localhost/rpc -XPOST -d '{
    "request": {
        "name": "test",
        "capacity": 100,
        "max_weight": 200000,
        "available": true
    },
    "method": "VesselService.Create",
    "service": "vessel"
}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Here, our gRPC services, being proxied and converted to a web friendly format, using a sharded, MongoDB instance.

### Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

We will set up all of this into a CI process to manage our deployments.

**Set up CircleCI with our services**

First, sign-up and create a new project in CircleCI.

Next, change your build configuration (let's use our shipment-service for this).

Open [shipment-service build configuration](./neocargo-service-shipment/.circleci/config.yml)
in your editor. In order to make this work, we need Google Cloud service account
key, such as the one we created in ["Deployment" section](#Deployment) of this
README, and we need to encode this into base64 and store it as an environment
variable within our CircleCI build project settings. You can read more about
environment variables and how to use them on [CircleCI 2.0 here](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/).

That's it. We have CI for one of our services. For a production-grade service,
I recommend you run your tests first, before your deploy step.
